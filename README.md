# vk gifs

I want to keep the repo clean (don't want the dist folder here), so I deployed it on vercel. I used my own domain because vk blocks redirect to `*.vercel.app` for some reason.

## Motivation

VK is a Russian social where you also can save staff like gifs. Because on the actual page it looks awful (gifs are small and arranged in one column), I once made this app for myself.
Then I decide to make it better and to try out vue 3.
I wanted to try the new `<script setup>` syntax, then also adopted tailwind and vite.
