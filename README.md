# vk gifs

I want to keep repo clear (don't want dist folder here), so I deployed it on vercel. I used my own domain because vk blocks redirects to `*.vercel.app` for some reason.

## Motivation

VK is a russian social where you also can save staff like gifs. Because on the actual page it looks awful (gifs are small and arranged in a one column), I once made this app for myself.
Then I decide to make it better and to try out vue 3.
I wanted to try new `<script setup>` syntax, then also adopeted tailwind and vite.
